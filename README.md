## Description

The Image Caption Generator is a deep learning-based project that generates captions for images using a combination of computer vision and natural language processing techniques. Given an input image, the model can describe the visual content in human-readable sentences, making it a useful tool for applications like assisting visually impaired users, enhancing image search, and more.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to generate coherent and contextually relevant captions. It can be used as a stand-alone tool through the command-line interface or integrated into other applications via an API.

## Demo

Provide a link or instructions to access a live demo showcasing the image caption generator in action.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image_Caption_Generator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Image_Caption_Generator`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the pre-trained CNN weights and place them in the `models` directory.

## Usage

1. Prepare your image and place it in the `images` folder.
2. Run the caption generator script: `python generate_caption.py --image_path images/your-image.jpg`
3. The generated caption will be displayed in the console.

## Model Architecture

Explain the model's architecture, providing details about the CNN and LSTM components, and how they work together to generate captions.

## Dataset

Mention the dataset used for training the model. If it's a custom dataset, explain how it was collected and preprocessed. Provide links to the dataset if available.

## Training

Provide instructions or scripts for training the image caption generator from scratch. Include information about hyperparameters, training data splits, and evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation

Explain how the model's performance was evaluated, including any evaluation metrics used. Provide insights into the model's strengths and limitations.
